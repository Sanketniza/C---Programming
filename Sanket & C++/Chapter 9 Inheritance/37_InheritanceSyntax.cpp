   * 1-> default visibility mode is private.
   * 2-> public derivation mode : Public members of the base class becomes public members of the derived class.
   * 3-> private derivation mode : Public and private members of the base class becomes private members of the derived class.
       --> here private members of the base class are never inherited
   * 4-> protected derivation: Public and private members of the base class becomes protected members of the derived class.
